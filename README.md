By reading this book, I would accomplish the following goals
 
1. Improve My English Vocabulary
1. Understand The Way to Manage Data

I will note in summary

# read

In addition to this, I created `book` command. I describe how to use this.
1. git clone this repository
1. `rye run python3 -m build`
1. `rye install .`
1. `book set-config`: You decide where you want to manage a file directory.
    - For instance, `./resources` directory is selected in this repository.
    - If you want to read other books, you can change your path to manage your reading.
1. `book aim`: You can set your aim: (total pages, pages you want day and one rest date in some duration)
1. `book progress`: You can manage 1 date progress.
    - This program creates a burn-down chart automatically.
    - For instance, `./resources/2023-07-22.png`
